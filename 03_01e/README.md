# Configure your svelte app with tailwind css

The code in this file only contain the [hero template](https://tailwindui.com/components/marketing/sections/heroes) of talwindui, you can clone this repo to use for your Svelte project by removing the `hero.svelte` and begin to design your svelte app with tailwind css.




## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd configure-svelte-and-tailwind
npm install
```


...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
