# Building an Application with Svelte and Firebase
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Building an Application with Svelte and Firebase. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

Svelte and Firebase both try to use the simplest set of tools possible in different ways. Svelte is a front-end, component-based framework that offers enhanced performance and a more approachable developer experience. Firebase is a backend-as-a-service platform that makes it easier to build and monitor great apps. In this course, learn how to combine the dependency-free client approach of Svelte with the core set of lightweight data storage tools in Firebase to create a quick foundation application. Instructor Ayodele Leom covers everything from basic setup to interactive design with Svelte.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
